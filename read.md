Practice 1
Task:
1.Create a variable called number and assign it any integer.
2.Use an if-else block to print whether the number is positive, negative, or zero using console.log().

Practice 2

Practice 4
Task:
1.Create a variable called count and initialize it to 1.
2.Use a while loop to print the multiplication table of 5 (e.g., 5 × 1 = 5, 5 × 2 = 10) until 5 × 10.
3.Use console.log() to display each step.

     
Practice 5
Task:
1.Declare and initialize a number with value of 0
2.Write a do-while loop that Checks if that number is greater than 10.
3.Keep Incrementing the number by 1.
4.Use console.log() to print "The number is: [number]".

Practice 6
Task:
1.Write a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
2.Use a break statement to exit the loop when the number 5 is reached. 3.Use console.log() to print each number.

Practice 7
Task:
1.Write a for loop that prints only even numbers between 1 and 20.
2.Use a continue statement to skip odd numbers. 
3.Print each even number using console.log().


Practice 8
Task:
1.Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and divides the
first by the second.
2.Use try-catch-finally to handle division by zero.
3.Print the result if the division is successful, otherwise print an error message.

Practice 9
Task:
1.Write a function called multiply that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their product.
2.Call the function with any two numbers and print the result using console.log().

Practice 10
Task:

2.Print 'Fizz' if the number is divisible by 3.
3.Print 'Buzz' if the number is divisible by 5.
4.Print 'FizzBuzz' if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
5.Use console.log() to print each result.
